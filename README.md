# mockdbs-scala

From the [website](http://mockdbs.com)

    MockDBS is a simple program that simulates signals generated by
    neural features encountered during a Deep Brain Stimulation
    procedure.  It allows the user to place simulated neurons along a
    test track, then descend a simulated probe along that track.  It
    was originally created for use at the University of Colorado
    Health Sciences Center as a participatory site in the GAD2 Viral
    Vector study, to facilitate adherence to control group protocol.
    Audio output of simulated neurons is produced as the simulated
    probe is descended.

This port is a work in progress: uber-alpha quality.

## Why scala?
I wanted access to a strongly typed language with some of the functional characteristics notably absent from Java.  I've also used this port to explore implementation of MVC patterns for swing apps, something that (I think) could be elegantly implemented in Scala.

## Problems?
